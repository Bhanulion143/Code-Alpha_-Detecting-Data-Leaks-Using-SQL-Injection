 Detecting Data Leaks Using SQL Injection
✅ 1. Project Title and Description
Title:
Detecting Data Leaks Using SQL Injection

Description:
Explain what the project is about and its core objective — protecting cloud-based systems from SQL injection attacks using encryption, access control, and layered security.

✅ 2. Key Features / Objectives
List out the main goals your system achieves:

✔️ Prevent SQL injection attacks.

✔️ Encrypt sensitive data using AES-256.

✔️ Use a capability code mechanism for controlled SQL execution.

✔️ Apply a double-layer security protocol (input validation + access control).

✔️ Be lightweight and accessible on cloud platforms.

✅ 3. Technology Stack
Clearly mention the technologies used for implementation:

Area	Technology
frontend	html,css,react / Node.js/type script
Database	PostgreSQL / MySQL/mongodbsql
Encryption	AES-256 (cryptography, crypto)
Security	JWT / Role-based Access / Input Filters
Deployment	Docker, Heroku, AWS, Render

✅ 4. Installation Instructions
Provide step-by-step setup:

Clone the repository.

Install dependencies (pip install or npm install).

Set environment variables (DB URI, encryption key, secret key).

Run the application.

Optional: Deploy using Docker or cloud.

✅ 5. Usage Guide
Show how to:

Register a user (data gets encrypted).

Log in securely.

Inject queries using a capability token.

View logs or admin alerts for SQL injection attempts.

✅ 6. Security Details
Explain your security mechanisms:

🔐 AES-256 Encryption:
Used to protect passwords and private user data. Encryption keys are never stored in plain text.

🧾 Capability Code System:
A one-time token or access key grants permission to run specific SQL queries securely.

🛡️ Double-Layer Security Protocol:
Layer 1: Input sanitization, prepared statements, encrypted communication.

Layer 2: Role-based access control, logging, and anomaly detection.

✅ 7. Deployment Instructions
Explain how to deploy the system online:

Using Docker: Provide Docker commands.

Using Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean: Mention any config settings, supported environments.

Mention that the system is lightweight and can run with 512MB RAM or 1 vCPU.
